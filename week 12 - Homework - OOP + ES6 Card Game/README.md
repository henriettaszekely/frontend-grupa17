Create a playing card game, using the code from [OOP workshop Card Game](https://github.com/henriettaszekely/frontend-grupa17/tree/master/week%2011%20-%20OOP%20Workshop%20Card%20Game).

The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want to be, but it needs to have a finality 
(i.e. some clearly defined win/lose conditions).

You need to have a graphical user interface, the cards should be displayed using HTML elements and not only in the console.

You can use the CSS from the workshop to display the cards, modify it or display them using other implementations 
(original or found on the internet).

Make sure to comment your source code, and motivate your chosen class/method design and implementation.

The win/lose/tie message should also be displayed using HTML elements.

A refresh/replay button is not necessary.

You can use [Card Game Rules](https://bicyclecards.com/rules/?results=show#filter=.2) for inspiration on choosing a game
to implement.

Provide a link to the game rules, so that the user can understand what game he's playing.

If you deviate from the rules of a certain game, or you invent others, make sure the rules are visible to the user. 

Make sure to use the ES6 syntax elements(if needed):
* let, const instead of war
* arrow functions
* class syntax
* rest parameters, spread operator
* destructuring
* modules
* etc.
